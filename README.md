# Smart-Street-Poles-IoT-ATmega2560
IoT-based smart street pole system for pedestrian walkways, enabling energy-efficient lighting, environmental monitoring, and public safety. Uses ATmega2560 edge nodes with ZigBee communication to a Raspberry Pi 3 gateway and MQTT-based CCC integration. Fully simulated using Proteus with a future roadmap toward real-world.
